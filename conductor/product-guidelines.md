# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style

The desired prose style for the project's documentation and user-facing text is **Friendly and Explanatory**. This approach aims to make the project accessible to a broader audience, including developers and less experienced users, by adopting a helpful and clear tone. Concepts should be explained in an accessible manner, ensuring that information is easily understood without sacrificing accuracy. The goal is to foster a welcoming environment and facilitate a smooth learning curve for all users.
