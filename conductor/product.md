# Initial Concept

The "Web Shell Odoo" project aims to enhance the Odoo development experience by providing integrated tools for real-time code execution and log monitoring.

## Primary Objectives:

*   **Floating Python Console**: To provide a powerful terminal interface allowing users to execute Python code with direct access to the Odoo environment (`env`, `request`, etc.) directly from the Odoo web client.
*   **Real-time Log Viewer**: To enable developers to monitor Odoo server logs in real-time directly from the browser, facilitating immediate feedback on system activity.
*   **Ace Editor Integration**: To offer a professional code editing experience within the web shell by integrating the Ace Editor, providing syntax highlighting and other advanced editing features.
